<h2>FIRST EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR COMMUNION WITH GOD.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"Abide with us; for it is towards evening, and the day
is far spent."&mdash;Luke xxiv.&nbsp;29.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God,</span> I desire to approach Thy throne of
Grace on the evening of this day, beseeching
Thee to grant me Thy benediction and blessing.
The shadows of night have once more gathered
around me; may no shadow of sin or unbelief
darken my soul, or interrupt my communion
with Thee. "It is not night if Thou art near."
Let me enter the inner chamber of Thy presence,
and experience conscious fellowship with
Thee my Father in Heaven.</p>

<p>Do Thou graciously forgive all the sins of
the past day, its sins of omission and of commission,
of thought, and word, and deed. Hide
me anew in the clefts of the Smitten Rock. I
confidently repose my everlasting interests on
the finished work and righteousness of a tried
Redeemer. May I know more and more of the
attractive power of His Cross&mdash;the adaptation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
of His character and work to all the wants and
weaknesses, the sorrows and infirmities, of my
tried and suffering and tempted nature. May
I live more under the sovereign motive of love
to Him, and experience more the happiness of
life spent in His service.</p>

<p>Gracious Lord! may a sense of Thy favor
penetrate with its leavening power every duty
in which I engage, lessening every cross and
sweetening every care. Take what Thou wilt
away, but take not Thyself; no earthly good
can compensate for the loss of Thy friendship.
Existence would be one vast blank without
Thee. Give me to realize the blessedness of
unfaltering dependence on Thy covenant mercy,
knowing that all which befalls me is the pledge
and dictate of unerring love, and that nothing
can come wrong that comes from Thy hand.</p>

<p>Thus while my daily walk is hallowed and
brightened by Thy presence and fellowship, may
I be enabled to look calm and undismayed on
the unknown and chequered future, feeling that
even over the gloomy portals of the grave, with
Thee as my Portion and Heritage, I can write,
"To die is gain!" Meanwhile do Thou fit me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
for every duty, prepare me for every trial. If
Thou givest me the "full cup," give me grace
to carry it with a steady hand. If Thou sendest
adversity, let me regard it as Thine own gracious
discipline, to wean me from earth and train me
for glory.</p>

<p>May it be my great ambition, through the
help of Thy Blessed Spirit, to attain a gradual
resemblance to the character and conformity to
the will of my adorable Redeemer. May I be
clothed with humility. May I be daily becoming
more meek and gentle, more contented and
thankful, more submissive and resigned, watching
against anything in my heart or conduct
that I know would be displeasing to Thee,
making it my meat and my drink to do Thy
holy will.</p>

<p>Thou unslumbering Shepherd of Israel, vouchsafe
Thy guardian care to all near and dear to
me: shield them from danger: give Thine
angels charge over them; sanctify them body,
soul, and spirit; seal them unto the day of
eternal redemption.</p>

<p>May we all lie down to sleep this night in
Thy fear, and awake in Thy favor, fitted for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
duties of a new day. And all I ask is for
Jesus' sake. Amen.</p>

 <p class="gap-above center small">"LET MY PRAYER BE SET FORTH BEFORE THEE AS<br />
 INCENSE: AND THE LIFTING UP OF MY HANDS<br />
 AS THE EVENING SACRIFICE."</p>

<hr />

<h2>SECOND EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR PARDONING GRACE.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"For Thy name's sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity;
for it is great."&mdash;Ps. xxv.&nbsp;11.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gracious God!</span> do Thou look down upon
me this night in Thy great mercy. May I
have now the inner sunshine of Thy presence!
Ere I retire to rest, let me pitch my tent near
Thyself, and enjoy the tokens of Thy favor and
blessing. Thy loving-kindness has been new to
me every morning, and Thy faithfulness every
night.</p>

<p>I desire to render Thee the thank-offering of
a grateful heart. My life is one wondrous
attestation to Thy patience and forbearance.
The kindness of the best earthly friend has
been nothing to Thine. Thou mightest long
ere now have left me to reap the fruits of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
own guilty estrangement, withdrawing the grace
and Spirit I have so long resisted, executing
against me the awful doom of the cumberer.
But I am still spared, a living monument of
mercy. Thy ways are not as man's ways, nor
Thy thoughts as man's thoughts.</p>

<p>Lord, I would seek anew this night to close
with the alone Sovereign remedy! Jesus!
there is no other prop but Thee to support a
sinking soul and a sinking world. There is
nothing between me and everlasting destruction
but Thy glorious work and finished righteousness.
I rejoice to think that it is all I need&mdash;living
or dying, for time or for eternity. O blot
out in Thy precious blood my many, many sins.
Nothing in my own hands I bring; I cling
simply to Thy cross. Mercy and truth have
there met together; righteousness and peace
have embraced each other. Reposing in what
Thou has done, and in what Thou art still
willing to do, I can rejoicingly say, "Return
unto thy rest, O my soul."</p>

<p>Bring me to live more habitually under the
constraining influence of redeeming love. Purchased
at such a price, may I be willing freely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
to consecrate soul and body to Thy service.
Let me feel that the bitterest of all trials is the
forfeiture of Thy favor and love, and the loftiest
joy is the assured possession of Thy gracious
friendship. May my spirit be brought into
blessed unison with Thine. May I become
more gentle, and resigned, and submissive, and
unselfish; more heavenly-minded; more Saviour-like.
May I be led to regard <i>all</i>, even
Thy darkest dealings to me here, as needful
parts in Thy plan of stupendous wisdom. May
I rest contented in the assurance that what I
know not now I shall know hereafter.</p>

<p>Unite me to all my dear friends, and them to
me, in the bonds of Christian love. Amid all
the fluctuations of this mortal life, may we ever
have grace given us to cleave unto the Lord
with full purpose of heart. Treading the same
pilgrim-journey, may we arrive at last at the
same pilgrim-home.</p>

<p>I would retire to rest this night with my eye
on the opened fountain. O give me that peace
of Thine which the world knoweth not of, which
the world cannot give, and, blessed be God,
which the world cannot take away! Abide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
with me, for it is towards evening, and the day
is far spent. Give thine angels charge over me
during the unconscious hours of sleep, and,
when all my evenings and mornings shall be
finished, may it be mine to wake up with Thyself
in glory everlasting, through Jesus Christ
my only Lord and Saviour. Amen.</p>

 <p class="gap-above center small">"LET MY PRAYER BE SET FORTH BEFORE THEE AS<br />
 INCENSE: AND THE LIFTING UP OF MY HANDS<br />
 AS THE EVENING SACRIFICE."</p>

<hr />

<h2>THIRD EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR RENEWING GRACE.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"Renew a right spirit within me."&mdash;Psalm li.&nbsp;10.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blessed God,</span> I desire anew to end this
night with Thee! Do Thou enkindle my soul
as with a live coal from off Thy holy altar!
Let all unhallowed and obtrusive thoughts and
cares be set aside, that I may enjoy a season of
fellowship with the Father and with His Son
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>I rejoice to think that I have such a Friend
to repair to&mdash;such a never-failing refuge in
every season of perplexity and trouble; vicissitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
is written on all around me, but "Thou
art the same." Though often, alas! I have
changed towards Thee, Thou hast never
changed towards me. Thou didst love me from
the beginning, and that love remains to this
hour, infinite, unalterable!</p>

<p>Lord, I am mourning over my many and
grievous backslidings, my base and unworthy
requital of all Thine unmerited kindness.
Bring me in poverty of Spirit, with deep conscious
unworthiness, to say, "God be merciful
to me a sinner." Give me a realizing sense of
the evil of sin, and my own sin in particular.
I feel that I have no abiding and depressing
consciousness of my guilt. How little of genuine,
heartfelt contrition do I experience! How
often I <i>appear</i> to be humble and penitent
when I am <i>not</i>! How do my very prayers
condemn me; and my confessions of sin need
themselves to be confessed!</p>

<p>Oh renew me in the spirit of my mind.&mdash;May
all old things pass away; may all things
be made new. Transform me by the indwelling
power of Thy quickening Spirit. May affections
now alienated from Thee be reclaimed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
to Thy service. May I seek to be more animated
by the sovereign motive of love to Him,
whose I am, and whom it is alike my duty and
my privilege to obey. Knowing that this is
Thy will concerning me, even my sanctification,
may it be my constant ambition to be growing
in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>I have in myself no might, no power, no sufficiency,
to do any of these things. My sufficiency
is of Thee. Do Thou make Thy grace
sufficient for me, and perfect strength in weakness.
Keep me from all evil that would be
likely to grieve me. Wean me from all that is
fleeting and perishable here, and may all Thy
dealings towards me issue in the confirmed
habit of a holy life. If Thou sendest affliction,
let me regard it as Thine own way of dispensing
spiritual blessing, and bow with lowly submission
to Thy sovereign appointments.</p>

<p>Bless all my beloved friends. Keep them as
the apple of Thine eye. Hide them under the
shadow of Thy everlasting wings. Sanctify
trial to all in sorrow. Let the widow and the
fatherless put their trust in Thee. Succor the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
poor and him that hath no helper. Support
the aged. Sustain the dying. May we all
bear one another's burdens and so fulfil the law
of Christ.</p>

<p>As the pillar of cloud has been with me by
day, so may the pillar of fire be with me this
night. Watch over me during the unconscious
hours of sleep, and when I awake may I be still
with Thee. And all I ask is for the sake of
Jesus Christ, my only Saviour. Amen.</p>

<span class="small">FOR SANCTIFYING GRACE.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth."&mdash;John xvii.&nbsp;17.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blessed Lord,</span> do Thou bend Thy pitying
eye of love and mercy upon me this evening.
Draw Thou near to me as I venture once more
on praying and on pleading ground. I desire
to feel that I am one night nearer glory. Oh,
enable me to feel, as night after night is silently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
stealing over my head, that my seasons and opportunities
of grace are fleeting fast away, and
that soon the night cometh, wherein I can work
no more.</p>

<p>Alas! O God, how little have I improved the
time that is past! I am a wonder to myself,
that with all my deep ingratitude and utter
vileness I am yet permitted to approach Thy
footstool: I have sinned against light and love&mdash;warning
and mercy&mdash;grace and privilege.
The retrospect of life is a retrospect of guilt.
I mourn over my manifold shortcomings&mdash;the
alienation of my heart from Thee&mdash;the fitfulness
of my spiritual frames&mdash;the ebbings and flowings
in the tide of my love. When tried by the
lofty and unerring standard of Thy law, how are
my best actions and duties marred with defilement!
How much self-seeking and self-glorying&mdash;how
little animated by the predominating
motive of love to Thee, and singleness of eye to
Thy service!</p>

<p>Blessed Jesus! I flee anew to the pavilion
of Thy love. I have no other hope, no other
refuge, but in Thy finished work&mdash;Thy matchless
atonement&mdash;Thy spotless righteousness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
There is in Thee an all-sufficiency for every
want. Finite necessities cannot exhaust Infinite
fullness. Let me hear Thy voice saying, "Thy
sins, which are many, are all forgiven thee!"
O sprinkle me with Thy blood; sanctify me,
body, soul, and spirit. Transform me more and
more into Thine own image. May I know more
and more the happiness of true holiness&mdash;that I
am really blessed in seeking to walk so as to
please God. May the power of grace wax
stronger and stronger, and the power of sin wax
weaker and weaker. May trials and crosses
become light and easy to me when borne in a
spirit of meek, unrepining submission to the
Divine will. May this quiet every doubt and
misgiving, "Your heavenly Father knoweth
that ye have need of all these things." Lord,
may every providential dealing prove a heart-searcher,
testing the reality of my love to Thee,
and my meetness and preparedness for Thy
heavenly kingdom.</p>

<p>Extend, Lord, Thy cause and Gospel everywhere.
Strengthen Thy missionary and ministering
servants. May they ever hear the sound
of their Master's footsteps behind them. May
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
thy churches walk in the fear of God and in the
comfort of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Bless all my beloved friends wherever they
are; do Thou be their Almighty Protector and
Guide. Let the angel come at this the time of
evening incense, touching all our hearts, and
granting us an answer to our several petitions.
Let us rise to-morrow refreshed for Thy service;
and fitted for whatsoever in Thy good providence
we may be called either to do or to suffer.
Hear me, gracious God, for the sake of Him
whom Thou hearest always. Amen.</p>

<h2>FIFTH EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR RESTRAINING GRACE.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"Keep back Thy servant also from presumptuous
sins."&mdash;Psalm xix.&nbsp;13.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blessed God,</span> Thou hast in Thy mercy permitted
me to see the close of another day.
With what unwearying watchfulness has Thou
been compassing my path!&mdash;defending me from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
danger, guarding me from temptation, hedging
up my way with thorns, "preventing me with
the blessings of Thy goodness!" There is no
friend in the world I have like Thee; none so
able, none so willing to be my friend. If I
have been successful in resisting sin, it is all
Thy blessed grace which has enabled me.
From how many slippery places has Thou
rescued me! When often on the brink of the
precipice, ready to fall, Thy interposing hand
has saved me from inevitable destruction.
When through my own weakness and unwatchfulness
I must now have been wandering
in hopeless alienation from Thee, Thou hast
mercifully not suffered the bruised reed to be
broken, nor the smoking flax to be quenched.</p>

<p>Lord, my earnest prayer is that Thy grace
may still be made sufficient for me. May no
spiritual foe be allowed to invade my peace or
endanger my safety. Let Thy love be restored
to its rightful ascendancy in my affections.
May no rival be allowed to usurp its place.
May I ever exercise a holy jealousy over this
truant, wandering, deceitful heart; seeking day
by day to subdue unmortified sin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
May all Thy dispensations issue in my sanctification.
Let me seek no unruffled path; may
the cross be willingly carried. Thou lovest me
too well to give me my own way. Whatever
Thy will and Thy dealings may be, be it mine
cheerfully and rejoicingly to acquiesce in them,
knowing them to be the dictate of infinite
wisdom and unchanging love. May all my
worldly business and engagements be interfused
and hallowed with the blessed sense and
assurance of Thy favor! Walking all the day
in the light of Thy countenance, I must be
safe!</p>

<p>God of Bethel&mdash;God of all the families of
the earth, vouchsafe Thy richest benediction
on all near and dear to me. Give thine angels
charge over them; let their names be written
among the living in Jerusalem; and oh, may
we all seek in our several spheres to glorify
Thee on earth, either by active duty or by
patient endurance; exemplifying in our daily
walk the meek and lowly, the unselfish and
self-denying, spirit of Him, who hath left us
an example that we should follow His steps.</p>

<p>Hasten the coming of Thy Son's kingdom.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
Arise, O God, and plead Thine own cause.
"Save Thy people, bless Thine inheritance,
feed them also and lift them up for ever."</p>

<p>The curtain of night is again drawn around
me. If it be Thy will, spare me to see the
light and enjoy the comforts of a new day;
may I seek anew to enjoy them in Thee; may
every blessing be doubly sweet to me, bearing
the impress of Thy love in Jesus. Guide me
<i>in</i> life, <i>through</i> death, <i>into</i> glory, for the sake
of Him in whom is all my hope, and to whom,
with Thee the Father, and Thee, ever-blessed
Spirit, one God, be ascribed all blessing and
honor and glory and praise, world without end.
Amen.</p>

<h2>SIXTH EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR RESTORING GRACE.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation."&mdash;Ps. li.&nbsp;12.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blessed God,</span> I rejoice to know that the
gates of prayer are ever open;&mdash;that for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
sake of Jesus Christ, my adorable Redeemer,
Thou art waiting to be gracious, not willing
that any should perish.</p>

<p>Come in the plenitude of Thy love this evening,
that I may feel it to be good for me to
draw near to God! Scatter my darkness, Thou
better Sun, with the brightness of Thy rising.
Give me filial confidence in approaching the
mercy-seat, rejoicing in the mightiest of all
Beings as my Father and Friend.</p>

<p>Blessed Jesus! I would exercise a simple confidence
and trust in Thy finished work, I would
seek to wash anew in the opened fountain of
Thy blood, to repose anew in the faithful saying
which never can cease, to the sin-stricken,
sin-burdened soul, to be worthy of all acceptation,
that Thou didst come into the world to
save the chief of sinners.</p>

<p>I have to mourn, O Lord, my constant proneness
to depart from Thee&mdash;the instability of my
best purposes of obedience. Unsupported by
Thy grace I must fall. There is nothing, O
Thou great Intercessor within the veil, but
Thine omnipotent pleadings between me and
irretrievable ruin. But Thou hast prayed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
art even now praying, for me that my faith fail
not. Oh if I am still prone to start aside, like
a deceitful bow, do Thou bring me back again!
Reclaim my truant heart from its wanderings.
I would cast myself with simple dependence on
Thy grace for the future. This is sufficient for
all wants and equal to all exigencies. Thine
everlasting arms are lower than my deepest
necessities. Adorable Saviour, I may well cast
my every care on Thee, for these cares Thou
makest Thine own. Thou hast a heart to feel
for those who have often no heart to feel for
themselves. Oh let me ever seek to hear Thy
directing voice and to hear no other.</p>

<p>Do Thou carry on within me Thine own
work in thine own way. Thou, Great Shepherd
of Israel, canst not lead me wrong. I
delight to trace Thy guiding love in the past,
and I may well trust Thee still; going up
through the wilderness may I lean on Thine
arm; when I come to die may the gloom of the
dark valley be lighted with the rays of Thy
love, and may I hear Thy voice whispering in
gentle accents, "Fear not, for I am with thee."
Be gracious to all my beloved friends. Train
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
them also, by Thy good Spirit, for eternity.
Fit them for every duty. Arm them against
every temptation. Dispose them to fear Thy
glorious name, and to live from day to day
under the powers and influences of a world to
come. Compassionate the afflicted; comfort
the bereaved; support the dying.</p>

<p>Lord, take the charge of me during the silent
watches of another night. May I rise on the
morrow to renew my work and warfare on
earth, looking forward to the time when the
twilight of this world shall melt into everlasting
day, and when nothing shall evermore mar
or interrupt the blessedness of endless communion
with Thee: through Jesus Christ, my only
Lord and Saviour. Amen.</p>

<h2>SEVENTH EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR QUICKENING GRACE.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"Quicken me after Thy loving kindness, so shall I keep
the testimony of Thy mouth."&mdash;Psalm cxix.&nbsp;88.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God,</span> on this the close of another day, I
desire to approach the footstool of Thy throne.
Glory be to Thy holy name that I can enjoy
freedom of access into Thy presence, and with
the confidence of a child unburden and unbosom
to Thee all my wants and sins, my sorrows
and infirmities, my perplexities and cares.</p>

<p>Lord, how unworthy I am of the least of all
Thy mercies! What righteous cause hast
Thou to cut me down as a cumberer of the
ground. How cold my love, how unfrequent
my prayers! How full my heart of pride and
vain-glory, self and sin! How little have I
habitually realized Thy nearness and sought
Thy favor as my chief good! There is enough
of coldness and formality in my best approaches
to Thy footstool to lead Thee in Thy wrath to
spurn me forever away, and to mingle my
blood with my sacrifices!</p>

<p>I cast myself as a worthless unworthy sinner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
at the feet of Jesus. I need daily, hourly
washing at that fountain which He has opened
for sin and for uncleanness. Wash me, gracious
Lord, fully, freely, and forever. Let me know
the blessedness of "no condemnation." Deepen
my contrition on account of my sin. I am apt
to palliate its enormity, to invent vain excuses
for its commission, to hide its heinousness from
myself, and to hide it from Thee. Let me see
all sin, and my own sin in particular, in the
light of Calvary's cross. May I hate it with a
perfect hatred, and resolve in Thy grace that it
henceforth have no dominion over me. Oh
quicken me by the indwelling of Thy blessed
Spirit. May I seek to be progressing in the
divine life. May my pathway heavenward be
brightened by a lively sense of reconciliation
through the blood of the everlasting covenant.</p>

<p>Let me lean on Thy heavenly arm, seeking
Thy glory with singleness of eye. May it be
my greatest grief to give Thee pain, my greatest
joy and happiness to do Thy will. Keep me
from all hard thoughts and unrighteous surmises
regarding Thy dealings. May I see them
all as designed to quicken my steps in the heavenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
way, to bring me nearer Thyself, and to
impart an increasing meetness for glory. Let
Thy kingdom come, let Thy blessed Gospel
triumph over the pride and superstition and will-worship
of man. Put an end to war and discord,
and may all the ends of the earth see Thy
salvation. Bless Thy ministering servants; may
they be valiant for the truth, and have no fear
but the fear of God.</p>

<p>Be the Guide and Guardian of all whom I
love. Preserve their bodies from danger and
their souls from sin. Watch over them and me
this night; be about our bed as Thou hast been
about our path. Night after night as I retire
to rest may I think of the deeper darkness of
the night of death, which must, sooner or later
encompass me. Reposing in the merits of my
gracious Redeemer, may I be enabled to look
<i>beyond</i> death and the grave, to that morning
without clouds, when I shall awake in His
likeness, and be ushered into the full vision and
fruition of Thee my God; and all that I ask or
hope for is for His sake. Amen.</p>

<h2>EIGHTH EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR IMPUTED RIGHTEOUSNESS.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of
Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe."&mdash;Rom.
iii.&nbsp;22.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Almighty God,</span> Father of all mercies, I desire
to draw near into Thy sacred presence on this
the evening of another day, under a deep sense
of my own great unworthiness. What am I,
guilty, sinful, polluted, that I should be permitted
to take Thy name into my lips, or so
much as lift up my eyes to the place where
Thou in glory dwellest!</p>

<p>I desire to renounce all dependence on myself.
I come with all the great burden of my
great guilt to a great Saviour. I seek to bring
the unrighteousness of an unworthy creature
to the infinite righteousness and everlasting
faithfulness of a tried Redeemer. Where would
I have been, Blessed Jesus! this night, <i>but for
Thee</i>! All I am, and all I have, I owe to Thy
free, sovereign, unmerited grace. All my temporal
mercies are sweetened to me as flowing
from Thy cross, and bearing on them the image
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
and superscription of Thy love. And for every
spiritual blessing I enjoy, and every spiritual
hope I entertain, I desire doubly to adore thee,
Thou Great Author and Finisher of my faith!
Whom have I in heaven but Thee, and there is
none in all the earth I desire besides Thee.
Thou alone canst fill up the aching voids of my
heart. In vain can I look to a transient world,
or to the perishable creature, for solid peace and
permanent enjoyment. All my well-springs are
in Thyself; with Thee for my portion I am
independent of every other.</p>

<p>I desire this night to obtain a lively and
humbling view of my own spiritual poverty and
deep creature destitution, that I may rejoice in
the fullness and all-sufficiency of that righteousness
which is unto all and upon all them that
believe. In that righteousness I would seek to
live, and in that righteousness I would seek to
die. There is nothing else between me and
everlasting ruin. But for Thee, Thou great
Covenant-Angel standing in the breach, the fire
of God would break forth and mingle my blood
with this my evening sacrifice! But I "will
greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
joyful in my God, for He hath clothed me with
the garments of salvation, He hath covered me
with a robe of righteousness." I take Thee, O
adorable Saviour, as mine only, mine wholly;
mine for all wants and all exigencies. I rejoice
in the inexhaustible riches treasured up in Thee&mdash;that
Thy fullness is adequate to supply all
my present necessities; and out of that fullness
I may still continue receiving, and that for ever
and ever!</p>

<p>Lord, look in great kindness on all whom I
love. Pity a perishing world. Arrest the careless;
reclaim the wandering; strengthen the
feeble. Hasten Thy Son's coming and kingdom.
How long shall the wicked, how long
shall the wicked triumph? Save Thy people;
bless Thine inheritance; feed them also, and
lift them up for ever.</p>

<p>Let the curtain of Thy protecting providence
be drawn around me this night. Let me fall
asleep at peace with Thee, ready, if need be, to
awake up in glory. And all I ask is for Jesus'
sake. Amen.</p>

<h2>NINTH EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR PEACE IN BELIEVING.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"Therefore being justified by faith we have peace with
God through our Lord Jesus Christ."&mdash;Rom. v.&nbsp;1.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gracious God,</span> I would seek to end another
day with Thee; I would desire to look up to
Thee through Jesus Christ, Thy well-beloved
Son, and to be made partaker of that peace
which passeth all understanding. There is no
other refuge for the sin-stricken, woe-worn
spirit. In vain amid other portions and meaner
joys can I say to my soul "peace, peace."
There is no peace! But reposing, blessed Saviour,
on Thy finished work and everlasting
righteousness, I have a peace which the world
knows not of, and which enables me to rise
superior to all the vicissitudes and changes of
this changing life.</p>

<p>I desire to remember with a grateful heart
that this peace has been purchased for me by
the blood of the cross&mdash;that it is made as sure
as everlasting power and wisdom and faithfulness
can make it. O Thou great Prince, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
hast power with God and dost prevail, I would
lift the undivided eye of faith to Thy bleeding
sacrifice! Do Thou dispel every disquieting
fear with the thought that Thou hast done all,
and suffered all, and procured all for me. Being
justified by faith, I have peace with God through
the Lord Jesus Christ. I rejoice in the plenitude
of Thy promises, that they are all yea and
amen to them that believe. Man's word may
fail, man's faithfulness may falter, but "the
word of the Lord is tried," Thy faithfulness is
unto all generations!</p>

<p>O God, enable me to rejoice more and more
in Thee as my everlasting portion. May I
know nothing to compare with the enjoyment
of Thy favor. Other props may be removed,
other refuges may prove refuges of lies, but
Thou art the strength of my heart and my
portion for ever.</p>

<p>Give me grace to be active in Thy service
while it is called to-day. Opportunities are
fleeting. The night cometh wherein none of us
can work. May simple believing be followed
by the earnest cultivation of every Christian
virtue, and by progressive advancement in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
heavenly life. May I faithfully employ the
talents Thou hast intrusted to me, and seek
never to be weary in well doing. Preserve me
from every unholy temper and unchristian deed.
May I be gentle and meek, patient and forgiving,
kind and benevolent, living in charity
towards all men.</p>

<p>On all my beloved friends I supplicate Thy
richest blessing. Protect them with Thy favor
as with a shield. Sanctify them, body, soul,
and spirit. Seal them unto the day of eternal
redemption.</p>

<p>Bless all poor afflicted ones. Let them receive
largely out of the wells of Thine own
everlasting consolation. Let them see Thy
sovereign hand alone in their trials, and say
with unrepining submission, "The Lord's will
be done!"</p>

<p>Lord, take the charge of me through the
silent watches of the night. May I fall asleep
listening to the gracious benediction, "Peace
be unto you." And when the gates of the
morning are opened, may it be to hear anew
Thy voice saying, "My presence will go with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
you." Hear, accept, and answer me, for the
Redeemer's sake. Amen.</p>

<h2>TENTH EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR THE SPIRIT OF ADOPTION.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"Ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we
cry, Abba, Father."&mdash;Rom. viii.&nbsp;15.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blessed Lord!</span> I desire to draw near this
night with holy boldness to the footstool of Thy
throne, rejoicing that I can look up to Thee as
my Father in heaven. "Behold what manner
of love is this the Father hath bestowed on me,
that I should be called a child of God." Thou
mightest have righteously left me orphaned,
friendless, portionless for ever. But in the
midst of wrath Thou hast remembered mercy:
the kindness of no earthly parent, O God, could
equal thine. Thou hast borne with all my obstinacy,
all my perverseness, and waywardness,
and ingratitude. I am at this hour the monument
of a love as wondrous as it is undeserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
Oh teach me to cultivate more and more a
spirit of child-like obedience to Thee; to cherish
a holy fear of offending so kind and forgiving
and beneficent a Father. Whilst Thou art
strewing my wilderness path with unmerited
blessings, may I be enabled to rise above every
earthly gift and mercy to the better inheritance
I have in Thee, the bountiful Bestower of all!
Let me feel every created blessing to be doubly
sweet, as emanating from a Father's hand, and
being a proof and pledge of a Father's love.
Let the hour of prayer be doubly hallowed by
the thought that I am permitted to haunt a
Father's presence, and pour my wants into a
Father's ear. Let the season of sorrow be
sweetened by the thought that the rod is in a
Father's hand, and that the voice, though apparently
rough, is the tender whispering of
parental love.</p>

<p>Blessed Jesus! I desire to remember that it
is Thou and Thou only who hast not left me
"comfortless." It is Thou who hast devised
and completed a way by which "Thy banished"
may not be "expelled" from a Father's presence.
Thou hast opened a door of welcome to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
the chief of sinners. It is Thy blessed voice
and Thy glorious work which utter the gracious
declaration, "In my Father's house there are
many mansions." Oh let me lean with a more
simple and entire dependence on Thee; let me
live from day to day with an unfaltering trust
in Thy mercy. May every new evening, as it
finds me laying the incense-offering of gratitude
and love on Thine altar, find me also a stage
nearer my Father's house, nearer <i>home</i>, and
nearer <i>Thee</i>.</p>

<p>Take all my beloved friends under Thy
shadowing wings this night. The darkness
can not screen them from Thee; the curtains
of night can not exclude Thy kind and watchful
eye. Guide, guard, protect them, and bring
them all at last to Thy heavenly kingdom.</p>

<p>Bless Thy Church everywhere; lengthen her
cords and strengthen her stakes. Be a wall of
fire around Thy Zion and the glory in the midst
thereof. Clothe her priests with salvation, let
her saints and people shout aloud for joy.</p>

<p>Bless those on whom Thou hast laid Thine
afflicting hand. May they take refuge in the
arms that are chastising them, and be enabled to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
say in unmurmuring submission, "The Lord's
will be done." Hear me, gracious Father, for
the sake of Jesus Christ, my blessed Lord and
Saviour. Amen.</p>

ever to depart away from Thee, the
living God. I mourn the debasing influence of
earthly things; the fascinating power of a present
evil world. How inclined to conform to its
evil maxims and unholy practices! How often
am I found ranged among those who "mind
earthly things;" my soul cleaving to the dust,
instead of soaring upwards to Thyself, my alone
satisfying portion!</p>

<p>Lord, it is my earnest prayer that Thou
wouldst wean me from the world. Keep me
from over-anxiety about the things that are
seen&mdash;from being over-careful and troubled
about earth's "many things," to the exclusion
of the one thing needful! Break every alluring
worldly spell; disenchant things temporal of
their false and delusive charm; disengage me
by all the salutary discipline of Thy providence
from what is fleeting, uncertain, transient,
perishable; and unite me to the things which
cannot be shaken, but which remain forever!
May my citizenship be more in heaven; imbibing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
more of the pilgrim spirit, may I declare
plainly that I seek a better country.</p>

<p>May the sins of the past day be forgiven;
may the blood of sprinkling wash their guilt
away. May I be driven nearer and closer to
Him who is the true refuge and portion, and
Saviour of His people. I rejoice to think that
He has a balm for every wound, a comfort for
every bosom, a solace for every tear. May it
be mine to go up through the wilderness leaning
on His arm. May Thy Holy Spirit carry
on His own work of sanctification within me.
May He enlighten, quicken, comfort, strengthen
me; and mould me in gradual conformity to
Thy divine will.</p>

<p>Bless all connected with me, by whatever tie.
When earth's separations are at an end, do Thou
take me and all dear to me to the enjoyment of
Thy presence and love in Thine own everlasting
kingdom. Let the pillar of Thy presence be
over us this night. Guard me during sleep's
unconscious hours. Let no unquiet dreams
disturb my repose; may I compose myself to
rest under the sweet assurance that Thou the
Lord sustainest me; and when I awake, may I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
be still with Thee, through Jesus Christ, my
only Lord and Saviour. Amen.</p>

<span class="small">FOR GRATITUDE FOR THE PAST.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His
benefits."&mdash;Psalm ciii.&nbsp;2.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God</span> Almighty, do Thou draw near to me
at this time in Thy great mercy, and accept of
this my Evening Sacrifice! I bless Thee for
all that gladdens my earthly lot, for food and
raiment, for friends and home, for health of
body and soundness of mind. Lord, I delight
to trace the wondrous way by which Thou hast
hitherto led me! Thou hast compassed my
path and my lying down. Thou hast supplied
my ever-recurring necessities. My wants have
been infinite, but infinite too has been the gracious
supply. With a grateful heart I would
set up my Ebenezer, saying, "Hitherto hath
the Lord helped me." And remembering Thy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
faithfulness in the past, I would confidently
trust Thee for the future.</p>

<p>May I thankfully employ the manifold gifts
of Thy bounty. Impress upon me the feeling
that I am but a steward, responsible to Thee
for all I possess. Let me not selfishly appropriate
the varied means of usefulness thou hast
put within my power, but willingly employ these
in Thy service for the good of others. When
Thou comest to demand a reckoning, may I be
able to give a faithful account of my stewardship,
paying Thee Thine own with usury.</p>

<p>Lord, while I bless Thee for the other proofs
and tokens of Thy love, far above all would I
bless Thee for <i>Jesus</i>. Where would I have been
this night but for <i>Him</i>? How dreary would
have been the past! How dismal and hopeless
the future! Thanks, eternal Thanks be unto
God for His unspeakable gift! Let me feel,
more than I <i>have</i> done, the exceeding riches of
Thy grace in Thy kindness toward me through
Christ Jesus. Let all Thy dealings only serve
to confirm my love to Him, and to lead me to
cleave to Him with fuller purpose of heart.
May he have my undivided homage. Let no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
earthly gift or blessing supplant the Giver, but
may every rill of creative bliss be doubly sweet
to me as flowing from His atoning sacrifice.</p>

<p>I rejoice in the midst of trial and perplexity
to think of Thee, Thou tried and suffering
<i>One</i>. I rejoice that amid my sorrows I can remember
<i>Thine</i>, that amid my very tears, I can
remember <i>Jesus wept</i>. Thou canst enter into
all the peculiarities of Thy people's case, for
Thou wert in "<i>all</i> points tempted." Let me
feel, even amid the changes of life, that what I
am apt to call vicissitudes, are the sovereign
decrees and allotments of Thine infinite wisdom;
and what I cannot comprehend now, be it mine
to wait the disclosures of that blessed morning
when, standing at the luminous portals of Heaven,
I shall joyfully acknowledge that the Lord
hath done all things well.</p>

<p>Bless my beloved friends; may they be
growing in thy fear and favor; may they all at
last, as sheaves in thy heavenly garner, be found
unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing
of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>I commend myself, gracious God, to Thy
care; let me retire to rest this night in the

spared to see the light of a new day, fit me for

<h2>THIRTEENTH EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR TRUST FOR THE FUTURE.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"I will trust, and be not afraid."&mdash;Isaiah xii.&nbsp;2.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God,</span> Thou makest the outgoings of the
evening and the morning to rejoice over me.
I thank Thee for Thy sparing mercy during
the past day. While multitudes of my fellow-men
have been called away into an eternal
world, I am still preserved in the land of the
living, and in the place of hope. It is of Thy
compassions alone that I am not consumed.</p>

<p>My way Zionward may well be studded with
Ebenezers, testifying "the Lord hath helped
me." I may well set to my seal that God is
true. The pillar of Thy presence has guided me
through many a perplexing path. Thy love has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
smiled through many a threatening cloud. Thy
restraining grace has arrested me in many a
slippery way; when "my soul was among
lions," how often has the Lord "sent his angel"
to rescue me and shut the lions' mouths. I am
this night a marvel and miracle of Thy patience,
and forbearance, and mercy.</p>

<p>Lord, I joyfully take all these past kindnesses
as tokens for the future. To Thee I would confidingly
commit the unknown morrow, and cleave
to Thy guiding arm with full purpose of heart.
The lot is thrown into the lap, but the whole
disposing of it is of the Lord; O, be it my joy
and privilege, thus reposing in Thy covenant
faithfulness, to say, "Undertake Thou for me."
Looking forward to that time when all Thy inscrutable
dealings will be unfolded, when inner
meanings and purposes now undiscerned by the
eye of sense will be brought to light, and all
discovered to be full of infinite love.</p>

<p>Keep me from dishonoring Thee by the
workings of unbelief; I am prone to trust my
own wisdom, O give me teachableness of spirit
and simplicity of faith, waiting patiently on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
Thee; leaving all that concerns me and mine
to Thy better direction.</p>

<p>Blessed Jesus! I would seek to cleave closer
and closer to Thy cross. I have no trust but in
Thy finished work. Other refuges may fail, but
I am as secure in Thee as everlasting love and
wisdom and power can make me. O cleanse
every guilty stain away in thy most precious
blood. Let me live day by day at the opened
fountain, and feel that I <i>only</i> "live" while
<i>there</i>. Thus simply relying on Thy justifying
grace, may I seek to walk in Thy footsteps and
to imbibe Thy spirit. May I follow Thee, O
Lamb of God, whithersoever Thou seest meet to
lead me. May I never feel as if I would wish
one jot or tittle regarding me altered, when the
reins of empire are in Thy hands.</p>

<p>Take my beloved friends under Thy special
care. Watch over them, provide for them,
decide for them. In all their ways may they
acknowledge Thee, and in all things seek Thy
honor and glory.</p>

<p>Pity the afflicted. Stay Thy rough wind in
the day of Thy east wind. Let them rejoice
that every bitter drop in the cup of life is appointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
by Thee. May they submissively drink
it, saying, "Thy will be done!"</p>

<p>Hear, Lord, the voice of my supplications,
when Thou hearest, forgive, and grant me an
answer in peace, seeing all that I ask is in the
name and for the sake of Jesus Christ, my only
Saviour. Amen.</p>

<h2>FOURTEENTH EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"That I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection,
and the fellowship of His sufferings."&mdash;Phil. iii.&nbsp;10.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Almighty God,</span> do Thou draw near to me
this night in Thy great mercy. What am I, that
infinite unworthiness and nothingness should
be permitted to stand in the presence of infinite
purity, majesty, and glory? Lord, I dare not
have ventured to bow at thy footstool in my
own merits. I am poor and wretched, and
miserable, and blind, and naked. Enter not in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
judgment with Thy servant, for in Thy sight no
flesh living can be justified.</p>

<p>But, adored be Thy name, I have an all-sufficient
ground of confidence wherewith to approach
Thee. I bless Thee, that by the doing
and dying of Jesus, Thou hast opened up a way
of reconciliation to the chief of sinners. Oh,
enable me to know more fully the adaptation of
His person and work to all the necessities and
exigencies of my character and circumstances.
Let me know him in His infinite Godhead, as
"mighty to save;" in His spotless humanity,
as mighty to compassionate. Let me know Him
in all His offices, as my Prophet, my Priest, my
King; my Kinsman-Redeemer within the veil,
my Refuge in trouble, my Guide in perplexity,
my Support in death, my Portion through eternity.
I rejoice, blessed Jesus, at the hidden
springs of life resident in Thee! Thou art
suited to all the varied wants and circumstances,
and trials of Thy people&mdash;for every moment of
need, for every diversity of situation. I can
mourn no real blank, if I have Thy presence and
blessing.</p>

<p>O Thou, better than the best of earthly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
friends, who, though enthroned amid the hosannas
of angels, hast still Thy human sympathy
unaltered and unchanged, draw near to
me this night, and breathe upon me, and say,
"Peace be unto thee." Let me know the melting
energy of Thy love, and the attractive
power of Thy cross. May I keep the unwavering
eye of faith steadily directed to Thy all-glorious
sacrifice. Be Thou the habitual object
of my contemplation, the source of holiest joy,
the animating principle of obedience. May all
creature love be subordinated to Thine. May
my temper, my walk, my conversation, be
regulated in accordance with Thy blessed will
and holy example. May this be the lofty aim
and ambition of life, to act so as to please
Jesus.</p>

<p>Bless my dear friends, may they too be led
to count all but loss for the excellency of the
knowledge of Christ Jesus their Lord, whom to
know is life eternal. Pity the careless; reclaim
the backsliding; comfort the sorrowful; sustain
the dying. May the Lord arise and have mercy
on Zion; may He show that the time to favor
her, yea, the set time, is come!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
Ere I lay my head on my nightly pillow, I
would lay anew my guilt on the head of the
Divine Surety; may I fall asleep under the
blessed sense of sin forgiven, and look forward
to that blessed day when earth's night-shadows
shall have vanished forever, and when I shall
be enabled more fully "to know the love of
Christ which passeth knowledge." And all I
ask or hope for is for His sake. Amen.</p>

<p class="center small">"Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for
I lift up my soul unto Thee."&mdash;Psalm cxliii.&nbsp;8.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God,</span> Thy favor is life, Thy loving-kindness
is better than life. Thy mercies have been new
to me every morning, and Thy faithfulness
every night. Thou hast watched over me from
the earliest years of infancy with more than a
Father's care. The kindness of the kindest on
earth has been coldness itself when compared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
with Thine. I rejoice that I can thus trace in
a wondrous past the visible footsteps of Thy
love, and fearlessly trust and repose in Thee for
the future.</p>

<p>Thou art a rich provider. None so able,
none so willing to guide me in every perplexity,
to extricate me from every difficulty, and to
befriend me amid the fitful changes of life.
What a safe anchorage is this amid the world's
restless surges of vicissitude, "The Lord
reigneth!" Do Thou enable me wholly to
follow the Lord my God; to follow Thee not
only in smooth places, but even when the path
is rough and the way thorny. May I confide in
the wisdom of all Thine allotments. I rejoice
that all the changes Thou orderest for Thy
covenant people are changes for the <i>better</i>, and
not for the <i>worse</i>.</p>

<p>O blessed Jesus! Thou who art the true
pillar of cloud by day, and of fire by night, do
Thou precede me ever in all my wilderness
wanderings. May I encamp only where Thou
leadest me. May I strike my tent only when
Thou speakest that I "go forward." Let me
experience the conscious happiness of knowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
no will but Thine, and of being solicitous in all
things to follow the guiding voice and footsteps
of the Great Shepherd of the flock. If there
be aught in Thy providence perplexing me now,
I would say in child-like simplicity, "I am oppressed,
undertake Thou for me!" "My heart is
overwhelmed, lead me to the Rock that is higher
than I." Hide me in the crevices of that smitten
Rock; let me know the safety and joy of
being shielded <i>there</i>, until earth's calamities be
overpast.</p>

<p>Graciously forgive all the sins of this past
day&mdash;the sins of thought, word and deed; all
my selfishness and uncharitableness; all my
pride and vain-glory; all my censoriousness
and inconsideration of the wishes and feelings
of others. Blessed Jesus! let me follow more
closely Thy holy footsteps, and drink more
deeply of Thy heavenly spirit.</p>

<p>Bless all in sorrow, sanctify to them their
trials, may they see and own a "need be" in
them all. Prepare the dying for death, and
spare useful lives.</p>

<p>Take all belonging to me this night under
the shield of Thy protecting providence, let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
them ever commit their way onto Thee, and do
Thou bring it to pass. Hold up their goings
in Thy word, that their footsteps may not
stumble.</p>

<p>Watch over me during the unconscious hours
of sleep; and when all my days and nights on
earth are finished, may it be mine to enjoy
Thy presence in a cloudless, nightless Heaven;

<p class="center small">"Sin shall not have dominion over you."&mdash;Rom. vi.&nbsp;14.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God,</span> Thou art of purer eyes than to behold
iniquity. Evil cannot dwell with Thee, fools
cannot stand in Thy presence. Thou hast
solemnly declared, "Thou canst by no means
clear the guilty," and that "though hand join in
hand, the wicked shall not escape unpunished."</p>

<p>Lord, I rejoice that I can draw near to Thee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
in the name of Him by whom the guilty <i>have</i>
been cleared; and through whom it is that a
holy and righteous and sin-hating God can yet
be holy and just, in the very act of justifying
the ungodly.</p>

<p>I desire to adore Thee for all Thy creative
and providential goodness. Thou hast loaded
me with Thy benefits. The past is paved with
love. I see in the retrospect of life nothing
but amazing, unmerited kindness, mercy upon
mercy! Amid manifold changes there has been
no change in <i>Thee</i>, no altered looks, no fainting
or weariness or estrangement. Amid the wanderings
of my own fitful spirit I can write over
every remembrance of the past, <i>But</i> "<i>Thou</i> art
the same!"</p>

<p>I desire with penitence of soul to mourn my
own ingratitude and sin, the desperate wickedness
and deceitfulness of my own evil heart,
the power of corruption, the mastery of self, the
alienation of my affections from Thee their
rightful Sovereign and Lord. What an easy
prey have I often fallen in the hour of temptation&mdash;by
thought and word and deed dishonoring
Thy name and basely requiting Thy love!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
Father, I have sinned against heaven and before
Thee, and am no more worthy to be called Thy
child!</p>

<p>Give me genuine contrition for the past, inspire
me with new purposes of obedience for the
future. Without Thy favor and reconciliation,
in peace I cannot live, in peace I dare not die!
My cry would be, "More grace, more grace!"
Let me be gaining every day fresh victories over
sin; may my soul be daily nurtured by the influence
of heaven-born principles. May I know
the expulsive power of the new implanted affection
of love to Thee. Dethrone the world.
Subjugate the power of sin. Give me greater
tenderness of conscience; may I jealously guard
every avenue to temptation, and be ready ever
with the reply to the seductions of the tempter,
"How can I do this great wickedness and sin
against God?"</p>

<p>Let me be willing to forego anything rather
than forsake Thy ways. Be it my habitual
purpose and desire to cleave unto Thee the
Lord with full purpose of heart. Let me hallow
all life's duties and engagements with Thy
favor, looking forward to that time when <i>my</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>

the interchange of love and devotedness.</p>

<p>Bless all my dear friends; may the blessing
of Jacob's God, the God of all the families of
the earth, rest upon them. Give them all
needful temporal blessings. Fill their souls
with peace and joy in believing. May they and
I look forward with joyful anticipation to that
"morning without clouds," which knows no
change nor vicissitude, when there shall be no
more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, because
there will be no more sin; and all I ask is for

day, adoring Thee for all the loving-kindness
Thou art continually making to pass before me.
May I ever be enabled to look up to Thee as
the Author and Bestower of all my mercies.
May no created good ever be suffered to dispossess
Thee of my affections. May all that I

Thou wilt guide me by a <i>right</i> way to the city
of habitation.</p>

<p>Above all would I seek a renewed interest
in those covenant blessings which Christ died
to purchase and which He is exalted to bestow.
All my hope is in Him; weak, helpless, perishing,
I flee to Him, as the help and hope and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
portion of all who seek Him. Hide me, O
blessed Jesus, in Thy wounded side. I would
overcome alone through the blood of the Lamb.
Wash me thoroughly in Thy precious blood.
May I hear Thine own voice of pardoning love
saying, "Your sins which are many are all forgiven."</p>

<p>After all Thou hast done for me, let me harbor
no guilty and unworthy suspicions of Thy
faithfulness. Let me feel assured that tender
love regulates all Thy allotments. Thou art
pledged to use the dealing and discipline best
suited for Thy people's case, and what will
best effect Thine own will concerning them,
even their sanctification. Carry on within me
Thine own work in Thine own way. Fortify
me against temptation; let me not surrender
myself to the base compliances of a world
lying in wickedness. But, strong in the Lord
and in the power of His might, may I know
that He who is with me is greater far than all
that can be against me. Oh enkindle afresh
my expiring, languishing love; let me live
more under the influence of "things not
seen," having the eye of faith more upwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
and homewards, looking for that blessed hope,
even the glorious appearing of the great God
my Saviour.</p>

<p>Let Thy kingdom come! Arise, O God, and
plead Thine own cause. May all the ends of
the earth soon be gladdened with the Gospel's
joyful sound!</p>

<p>Bless all in sorrow, all bereaved of near and
dear friends; may they see no hand in their
trials but Thine. Thou givest us our blessings;
and when Thou seest meet Thou revokest the
grant. Let us see love in every threatening
wave, all rolling at <i>Thy</i> bidding.</p>

Abide with me, blessed Saviour, for it is toward

ripening me for its never-ending joys. And
all I ask is for Jesus' sake. Amen.</p>

me; may I exercise a holy jealousy over my
own heart. Let no prosperity be strengthening
my ties earthward, and weakening my ties
heavenward. If Thou givest me much of
worldly good, may I write upon it all, "the
things which are seen are temporal." May
it be my exalted ambition to use it for Thy
glory. If Thou sendest trial, let it issue in
the peaceable fruits of righteousness, producing
a child-like acquiescence in Thy present dealings.
Let me never forget my pilgrim attitude.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
Let me be ever looking forward to that
joyous time when, "clean escaped" from the
corruptions that are in the world, I shall
stand "faultless before the Throne." Meanwhile,
make me more heavenly-minded, copying
the example of Him who was meek and
lowly in heart.</p>

<p>Let me be gentle and forgiving, let me not
harbor unkind suspicions of others, but consider
myself, lest I also be tempted. O give
me the <i>character</i> of Heaven on this side of
death, that when I come to pass through the
swellings of Jordan I may be prepared for the
joyous welcome awaiting me on the shores of
glory, "Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord!"</p>

<p>Have mercy on a world lying in wickedness!
Pity the careless; arouse the slumbering; support
the weak; succour the poor and those that
have no helper. Bless Thy Church everywhere.
May Thy ministering servants hide <i>themselves</i>,
that their Lord may be exalted.</p>

<p>Take the charge of me and of all near and
dear to me this night. Keep me, O keep me,
King of kings, beneath Thine own Almighty
wings. Lying down in Thy fear may I awake

<h2>NINETEENTH EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR RENUNCIATION OF SELF.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything
as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God."&mdash;2&nbsp;Cor. iii.&nbsp;5.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God!</span> do Thou bend Thy pitying eye upon
me this night, as I venture once more into Thy
sacred presence. What mercy it is that, with
all my great unworthiness, a throne of grace is
still open, and a God of grace is still waiting to
be gracious!</p>

<p>I come to Thee in deep creature-destitution,
bringing nothing in my hands, but simply
cleaving, blessed Jesus, to Thy cross; looking
away from my guilty self and my guilty doings
to Thee, who hast done all and suffered all for
me, I rejoice to think that Thou hast broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
every chain of condemnation&mdash;that Thou hast
satisfied the requirements of a broken law; and
having overcome the sharpness of death, Thou
hast opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.</p>

<p>Oh let me not continue in sin because all this
wondrous grace abounds. Let me not think
lightly of the accursed thing which was the cause
of all Thine untold and unutterable anguish. I
know, Lord, that I am apt at times to plead
vain excuses for my sins. I am unwilling to
think them, and to think myself, so vile as I
really am, in Thy pure and holy eye.</p>

<p>My heart is deceitful; but "Thou art greater
than my heart." Oh bring me in self-renouncing
lowliness to cry out, "God be merciful to
me a sinner." Let me cling to no remnants of
my own self-righteousness. Let me see that
my best actions are marred with defilement and
mingled with impure and unworthy motives.</p>

<p>Enable me to aim more and more at the conquest
of self. Show me the plague of my own
heart. Keep me from all that is unamiable and
selfish, from all that is unkind and uncharitable,
and that would exalt myself at the expense of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
others. Keep me holy. Keep me lowly.&mdash;Lead
me through the valley of humiliation.
May life become more one grand effort to crucify
sin and to please God. Take, gracious Saviour,
my whole heart, and make it Thine; occupy it
without a rival. May there be no competing
affection. Keep me from alienating existence
from its great end, by living to myself. May
this be the superscription on all my thoughts,
and duties, and engagements&mdash;"I am not my
own, I am bought with a price."</p>

<p>May whatever be Thy time be mine. May I
not murmur at deferred blessings or disappointed
hopes. May my own will be resolved into the
will of Him who knows best what to give and
what to withhold.</p>

<p>May the Lord have mercy upon Zion. May
showers of blessing descend on Thy holy hill.
Hasten the glories of the latter day, when Jesus
shall take to Himself His great power and reign!</p>

<p>Bless all my dear friends; may those ties
which may be so soon severed here be rendered
indissoluble by grace. Guard their couch and
mine this night; give us refreshing sleep, lying
down in Thy fear, and awaking in Thy favor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>

we ask or hope for is for the Redeemer's sake.

<h2>TWENTIETH EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR A CHILD-LIKE SPIRIT.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"My soul is even as a weaned child."&mdash;Psalm cxxxi.&nbsp;2.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O Lord,</span> I rejoice that I am permitted with
filial confidence to approach Thy blessed presence.
What a privilege it is to have such liberty
of access to the Mercy-seat&mdash;to look upwards to
Thee, the Infinite One, whom the Heaven of
Heavens cannot contain, and call Thee my
Father and my God! Earthly love may grow
cold or changeable, or perish; but "Thou art
the same." The mercy of God is from everlasting
to everlasting. Like as a father pitieth
his children, so doth the Lord pity them that
fear Him.</p>

<p>Alas! I have to mourn too often an unthankful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
spirit amid all Thy manifold mercies. I have
been rebellious and wayward, ungrateful and
selfish. Thou mightest righteously have surrendered
me to my own perverse will; left me
to the fruit of my own ways, and to be filled
with my own devices. It is of the Lord's mercies
that I am not consumed! Infinite is my
want, but infinite too is my help. I would seek
to stand before Thee, O God, in the nothingness
of the creature, and to know the boundless resources
treasured up for me in the great Redeemer.
Unite me to Him by a living faith, as
Thine own child by adoption; may it be my
great desire to glorify Thee, my Father in Heaven;
cherishing towards Thee a spirit of filial
love and devotedness, seeking to do only what
will please Thee, and having a salutary fear of
offending so kind and forbearing a Parent.</p>

<p>Oh keep me from any sullen fretfulness, or
unbelieving misgivings, under the strokes of
Thy chastening hand. Let there be no hard
construction of Thy dealings. May I see all
Thy chastisements tempered with gracious love&mdash;<i>all</i>
to be needful discipline. Give me an unwavering
trust and confidence in Thy faithfulness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
Nothing befalls me but by Thy direction;
nothing is appointed but what is for my
good.</p>

<p>Let Thy varied dealings conform me to the
image of my adorable Lord. Let me be willing
to suffer patiently for <i>Him</i> who so willingly
and so patiently suffered for <i>me</i>. Let me not
so much seek to have my afflictions removed as
to have grace given me to glorify Thee in them,
and in the spirit of a weaned child to say,
"Even so, Father!" O may my heart become
a living temple, my life a living sacrifice, breathing
the incense of gratitude and love. Let me
give myself no rest until in this soul of mine I
find a place for the Lord, an habitation for the
mighty God of Jacob.</p>

<p>Do Thou sanctify trial to all the sons and
daughters of sorrow. Draw near to those bereaved
of beloved relatives. Do Thou Thyself
compensate for every earthly loss. May they
know that Thou art faithful who hast promised,
"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end
of the world."</p>

<p>Have mercy on Thy whole Church. Heal
divisions. Bless Thy preached word. Strengthen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
Thy ministering servants, that they may be
enabled to proclaim the whole counsel of God.</p>

<p>Take the charge of me, and of all near and
dear to me, this night. Give Thine angels
charge over us. May no unquiet dreams disturb
our rest, and when we awake may we be
still with Thee. And all I ask is for Jesus'
sake. Amen.</p>

<p class="center small">"The path of the just is as the shining light, which
shines more and more onto the perfect day."&mdash;Proverbs
iv.&nbsp;18.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God,</span> I bless Thee that Thou hast spared
me during another day, and permitted the
shadows of another evening to gather around
me in peace. It is Thou, Lord, only who makest
me to dwell in safety. Enable me to live
from day to day as the pensioner on Thy bounty;
to feel my dependence; to receive every created
blessing and gift direct from Thy hand, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
seek to have all of them sweetened and hallowed
as the pledges of Thy covenant love in Jesus.</p>

<p>I bless Thee, gracious God, for the richer
tokens of Thy redeeming grace in Him. I bless
Thee that His infinite merit has come in the
place of my infinite demerit, that in Him there
is "no condemnation;" that in His precious
blood I have a secure shelter from the terrors of
Thy righteous law and the accusations of a
guilty conscience. May I know more and more
the power of His resurrection and the fellowship
of His sufferings. May my every hope of pardon
centre in His cross. May I be living from
day to day under the constraining influence of
His love, and experience now a sweet foretaste
of that everlasting communion which awaits me
in His presence hereafter.</p>

<p>Lord, quicken me in my heavenly way; let
me not loiter or linger on the road. Let this
be my habitual feeling and watchword, "I am
journeying." May I seek to mark my progressive
advancement in the divine life, my increasing
conformity to the image and will of Thee,
my God. Keep me humble, cherishing a constant
sense of my dependence on Thee. Oh in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
every step Zionward, may I be led to cry,
"<i>Hold Thou</i> me up, and I shall be safe." Let
there be no longer any halting between two
opinions, any wavering or indecision. May I
regard life as a great mission to please Thee.
Let my animating wish be to be nearer Thee
now, ere I come to be with Thee for ever in
glory everlasting. Walking heavenwards, may
I feel I am walking homewards.</p>

<p>May I spend each day as if possibly it were
my last, so that should the midnight cry break
upon my ears, "Prepare to meet Thy God," it
might be to me no unexpected summons, but as
an angel whispering, "The Master is come and
calleth for thee."</p>

<p>Look down in mercy on the dark places of
the earth full of the habitations of horrid cruelty.
How long shall the wicked, how long shall the
wicked triumph? Go forth with Thy missionary
servants in heathen lands; may they witness
much of Thy power; may Thy word still be
mighty as ever to the pulling down of Satan's
strongholds. Give thy Churches at home grace
to be more faithful in the fulfilment of the great
commission of their Great Head&mdash;"Go ye into

<p>Take all my beloved friends this night under
Thy guardian care. Shield them from all danger;
and if Thou art pleased to spare us till
to-morrow, may we rise refreshed and invigorated
for the duties of a new day. And all I ask
is for Jesus' sake. Amen.</p>

<p class="center small">"He giveth grace unto the humble."&mdash;James iv.&nbsp;6.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God,</span> Thou art great and greatly to be
feared. Thy greatness is unsearchable. Thou
art seated on a throne that is high and lifted
up; myriads of blessed spirits cease not day nor
night to celebrate Thy praise in their ever-triumphant
hymn, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord
God of hosts."</p>

<p>But I rejoice to think that though Heaven is
Thy dwelling-place Thou deignest to dwell in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
the humble and contrite heart; no sacrifice dost
Thou so love as that of the broken spirit; no
incense so prized by Thee as the incense of a
grateful, believing soul, which, oppressed with
its own unworthiness and sin, reposes with unwavering
trust in the work and righteousness of
the Great Surety.</p>

<p>Lord, on this ever-living, ever-loving Saviour
I desire wholly to lean. As helpless, hopeless,
friendless, portionless, I cast myself on Him
who is Helper of the helpless and Friend of the
friendless. There is nothing but Thy sacrifice
and intercession, O Thou Lamb of God, between
me and everlasting destruction. O wash every
crimson and scarlet stain away in Thy precious
blood. Let me lie low at the foot of Thy cross.
Give me a lowly estimate of myself, and a lofty
view of Thy all-glorious work and finished righteousness.
I have no other hope of mercy, and,
blessed be Thy name, I <i>need</i> no other.</p>

<p>While I take Thee as my Saviour, may I be
enabled to follow Thee also as my pattern; conscious
of the supreme enthronement of Thy love
in my heart, may I feel superior to all the fluctuations
and changes of a changing world. May
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
I live as the chartered heir of a better inheritance;
while in the world, may I seek not to be
of it. May I diffuse around me the noiseless
influence of a heavenly life, subordinating all
I do to Thy glory. Lord, enable me to be useful
in the sphere in which Thou hast placed me,
to work while it is called to-day, remembering
that there is no work nor device nor labor in
the grave whither I am going.</p>

<p>Bless all in sorrow. Sanctify their trials.
Keep us ever from the guilty atheism of looking
to second causes. May we ever rejoice in
the elevating assurance that "the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth," and that Thou orderest
all things wisely and well. May the Holy Spirit
the Comforter pour his own balm into every
bleeding heart.</p>

<p>Have mercy on a world lying in wickedness.
Hasten that glorious period when creation, now
groaning and travailing in sin, shall be delivered
from the bondage of corruption and be translated
into the glorious liberty of the children of
God. Let Thy word everywhere have free
course and be glorified. May Jesus, faithfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
"lifted up" by the attractive power of his cross,
draw all men unto him.</p>

<p>Let Thy best benediction rest on my friends.
The Lord watch between them and me when
we are absent one from another. May we experience
Thy guardian care this night; and if
spared to awake in the morning, may it be to
spend a new day in Thy service, through Jesus
Christ, our blessed Lord and Saviour. Amen.</p>

<p class="center small">"Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."&mdash;James
iv.&nbsp;7.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God,</span> Thou art from everlasting to everlasting.
Loving me at the beginning, Thou
hast promised to love me even unto the end.

own changing heart towards <i>Thee</i>, there <i>has</i>

<p>If I have been enabled in any degree to resist

I am "kept by the power of God." Unless the
Lord had been my help, my soul must long ere
now have dwelt in silence. By the grace of God
I am what I am.</p>

<p>Lord, indulged and cherished sin unfits me
for the enjoyment of Thy service and favor. I
have to lament my proneness to evil, the natural
bias of my heart to that which is opposed to
Thy pure and holy will. When I would do
good, sin is too often present with me. I feel
the power of my spiritual adversaries. If left
to myself and my own unaided resources, I must
often hopelessly resign the conflict.</p>

<p>But I rejoice to think that there is help and
hope and strength at hand. I would look to Him
who is now bending upon me an eye of unchanging
love from the throne. All Thy ascension
glories, blessed Redeemer, have not obliterated
the tenderness of Thy humanity. Thou art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
"that same Jesus;" Thou, the abiding Friend,
art still left changeless among the changeable;
and when Satan often desires to have me, that
he might sift me as wheat, it is Thy intercessory
prayer that saves me from utter ruin. Thou art
pleading for me, that my faith fail not! Oh
may I be found invincible in the hour of temptation,
being made more than conqueror through
Him that loved me. Sheltered in Thee the true
Refuge, the wicked one will touch me not.</p>

<p>Let me not trifle with my own soul or with
the momentous interests of eternity. Let me
every day be living under the realizing consciousness
that Thy pure eye is upon me. Keep
me from all that is at variance with Thy gracious
mind. Keep me from unchristian tempers, from
an unholy or inconsistent or uneven walk. By
a Christ-like demeanor may I exhibit the sanctifying
and transforming influence of the Gospel
on my own soul, that others may take knowledge
of me that I have been with Jesus.</p>

<p>God of Bethel! do Thou take under Thy
protecting providence all related to me by endearing
ties. However far we may be separated
from one another, let us never be separated from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
Thee. Let us often rejoice in this our common

in the one Golden Censer of our gracious
High Priest!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God,</span> I come into Thy presence this night,
rejoicing that amid all earth's vicissitudes, I
have in Thee a rock that cannot be shaken.
Thou doest according to Thy will in the armies
of Heaven, and among the inhabitants of the
earth! Thou doest all things well, and nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
but what <i>is</i> well. There is no finite wisdom in
Thy dealings. All is the result of combined
faithfulness, power, and love. Let me repose
in the righteous ordinations of Thy will. If
Thou withhold from me earthly blessings, let
me feel that the very denial is precious because
it is Thy sovereign pleasure. Covenant love
and wisdom cannot lead or teach me wrong;
every burden is imposed by Thee. The lot may
be thrown into the lap, but the whole disposing
thereof is of the Lord.</p>

<p>O Thou who turnest the shadow of death into
the morning, may every wilderness-storm only
drive me nearer Thyself, my true shelter. Thou
takest the sting from every cross, the bitterness
from every cup. Let me recognise in all that
befalls me the tokens of a Father's love; and if
sense and sight should at times fail to descry
"the bright light in the cloud," may I see
written over every dark trial Thine own unanswerable
challenge, "He that spared not his
own Son, but gave Him up to the death for us
all, how shall He not with Him also freely give
us all things?"</p>

<p>Lord! the end of all Thy sovereign dealings

is to subjugate my wayward will, and to unfold
more of the preciousness of Jesus. Blessed
Spirit of all grace! do Thou take of the things
that are Christ's and show them unto my soul.
Let me not stagger at the promises through unbelief.
Let me see nothing but love in the
past, love in the present, and love looming
through the mists of a cloudy future. Thou, O
God, art seated by every furnace; all is meted
out, all is provided for; all has a "need be" in
it! Magnify the power of Thy grace in me,
by a sweet spirit of patient submission to Thy
righteous ordinations. May I seek to have no
other prayer than this, "Father, glorify Thy
name." Impart Thou that inner sunshine
which no outward darkness or trial can obscure.
May the peace of God, which passeth
understanding, keep my heart.</p>

<p>May Thy Holy Spirit shed abroad His blessed
influences over the whole Church. Revive Thy
work, O God, in the midst of the years. In
wrath remember mercy. May Thy ministers be
more faithful. May Thy people be more close
and consistent in their walk with Thee. May
the young be growing up in Thy fear and favor;

may the aged find in Thee the staff of their declining
years. May the sick and afflicted pillow
their head on Thy promises. May the dying
fall asleep in Jesus.</p>

<p>I commend myself, my friends, and all belonging
to me, to Thy paternal care and keeping;
and when earth's long night-watches of
trial and sorrow are ended, may I wake up in
the sorrowless morning of glory, to enjoy uninterrupted
fellowship with Thyself. Through
Jesus Christ, my only Lord and Saviour.

<p>Lord, how sad is the contrast of Thine unwearied

Let me seek more than I have ever yet done, to
ask in the midst of life's duties and engagements,

faith, "Lord! what wouldst thou have me to
do?" Let me feel that duty is a delight when
done for Thee. Keep me from further relaxing

living sacrifices, and may I have the growing
experience that active obedience in Thy service
is self-rewarding.</p>

a brief time to do it in. May opportunities

given to Thee. May the warning words oft

for the night cometh wherein no man can
work." Oh prepare me for my Saviour's
coming. Forbid that I should be found among
the slothful servants or the faithless stewards
who are squandering their Lord's money, and
are living, forgetful that a time of reckoning is

<h2>TWENTY-SIXTH EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR THE SPIRIT'S TEACHING.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
sons of God."&mdash;Rom. viii.&nbsp;14.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O Lord,</span> Thou art the God of my life and
the length of my days. There is no real happiness
independent of Thee. Thy favor is
life. In vain can I seek for any satisfying
portion in an unsatisfying world. If bereft of
Thee I am bereaved indeed. But with Thy
countenance shining upon me, I must be safe,
I must be happy.</p>

<p>Do Thou pour down upon me the gifts and
graces of Thy Holy Spirit. May he "garrison"
my heart. May He write on its blood-besprinkled
lintels the superscription, "Holiness
to the Lord." Oh may this soul of mine
become a living temple, an "habitation of God
through the Spirit." Let me not trifle with
convictions. Let me not grieve by my hardness
and impenitency that gracious Agent, whereby
I am sealed unto the day of redemption; but
may all my affections be willingly surrendered
to His service. By His omnipotent energy may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
every high thought and lofty imagination be
brought into captivity to the obedience of Jesus.
May I be enabled to lean upon Him in the extremity
of my weakness. Fill me with all joy
and peace in believing that I may abound in
hope through the power of the Holy Ghost;
fitted for Thy service here, and for the enjoyment
of Thee forever hereafter.</p>

<p>I pray for the outpouring of the same blessed
Spirit on the whole Church. May He descend
like rain upon the mown grass, and as showers
that water the earth. Come from the four
winds, O Breath, and breathe upon the slain in
the valley! Hasten that glorious period when
the year of Thy redeemed shall come, when the
earth shall be full of the tabernacles of the
righteous, in which the voice of joy and melody
will continually be heard!</p>

<p>Oh that there were more in me of the mind
of my gracious Saviour, on whom the Spirit
was poured without measure. May I, like
Him, be more meek and gentle, more amiable
and forgiving, overcoming evil with good.&mdash;Transform
me into the same image from glory
to glory, by the Lord the Spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
Hide all my friends under the shadow of Thy
wings. Put Thy good Spirit also into their
hearts. May He guide them into all the truth,
and reveal to them more and more of the preciousness
of Jesus.</p>

<p>Let all poor afflicted ones rejoice in the presence
and consolations of the promised Comforter;
may He pour oil and wine into their
wounds; may He strengthen them in the midst
of all their tribulations, and enable them in
lowly resignation to say, "The Lord's will be
done." Teach us all to repose in that will as
the best; and to make it day by day our aim
and ambition to attain a greater conformity
to it.</p>

<p>Lord, take the charge of me through the
watches of the night. Under the blessed sense
of Thy presence and favor I would compose
myself to rest, and when I awake, may I be
still with Thee. And all I ask is for Jesus'
sake. Amen.</p>

<h2>TWENTY-SEVENTH EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR THE WORLD'S CONVERSION.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord,
as the waters cover the sea."&mdash;Isaiah xi.&nbsp;9.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God,</span> I desire to draw near into Thy blessed
presence, beseeching Thee to lift upon me the
light of Thy countenance and grant me a Father's
blessing. I am utterly unworthy of Thy
mercies. And it is only in Jesus, the Son of
Thy love, that I dare venture to cast myself at
Thy footstool.</p>

<p>I rejoice to think that in Him there is an
open door of welcome; that He has by His
doing and dying satisfied the demands of Thy
righteous law, and magnified all Thy glorious
attributes. I would bury all my sins in the
ocean-depths of His redeeming love. Oh let
me now know the blessedness of <i>living</i>, and at
last the blessedness of <i>dying</i>, at peace with
Thee, in the sure and certain hope of a resurrection
to eternal life.</p>

<p>Darkness is still covering the lands, and gross
darkness the people. Lord, do Thou have mercy
on a world lying in wickedness. I rejoice to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
think of all Thy glorious promises concerning
the latter day. That this creation of ours, now
groaning and travailing in bondage under sin, is
yet to be delivered from the yoke of corruption,
and to be translated into the glorious liberty of
the sons of God. Glorify Thy great name in
the salvation of sinners! Hasten the period of
predicted glory, when all the ends of the earth
shall see the salvation of God; when from the
rising of the sun to the going down of the same,
the Lord's name is to be praised. May Thine
own omnipotent Spirit brood over the darkness,
as He did over chaos of old, and say, "Let
there be light, and there will be light." May
gladsome voices soon be heard proclaiming,
"Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the
glory of the Lord is risen upon thee."</p>

<p>Oh may I know personally something of that
compassionate yearning over ruined souls and a
ruined world that my Saviour had. Let me be
prodigal in devising means for the extension of
His kingdom and the good of my fellow-men.
I would pray the Lord of the harvest that He
would send forth laborers to the harvest. Stand
by Thy missionary servants. May they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
many souls for their hire. May mountains of
difficulty be levelled before them; may crooked
things be made straight and rough places plain,
and may the glory of the Lord be revealed.
Let them exercise simple faith in the power of
Thy word and the efficacy of Thy grace. May
they feel that these are mighty as they ever
were to the pulling down of strongholds.</p>

<p>Arouse Thy churches to greater zeal. May
Jesus, faithfully lifted up by His servants, by
the attractive power of His cross draw all men
unto Him. May they be the honored instruments
of preparing many gems for Immanuel's
crown, who will be found unto praise and honor
and glory at His second appearing.</p>

<p>Lord, guard me through the silent watches of
the night; be the defence and protection of my
friends and relatives; may they too dwell under
the shadow of Thy wings and experience the
sleep of Thy beloved; and when the night of
earth's ignorance shall vanish away, may we all
wake up in glory everlasting, through Jesus
Christ, our only Lord and Saviour. Amen.</p>

<h2>TWENTY-EIGHTH EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR THE CHURCH'S REVIVAL.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"Revive Thy work in the midst of the years."&mdash;Hab.
iii.&nbsp;2.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God,</span> Thou hast permitted me in Thy great
mercy to see another evening. How many of
my fellow-men have this day slept the sleep of
death, and are now beyond the reach of grace
and privilege! I am still spared, all unworthy
though I be, a monument of Thy forbearance
and love.</p>

<p>I desire to make acknowledgment of my many
and grievous offences. They are more in number
than the sand of the sea;&mdash;sins against light,
and mercy, and warning; sins committed against
the kindest of Benefactors, the most indulgent
of Parents.</p>

<p>I would seek anew to take refuge in the
offered shelter of the Gospel, and to rejoice
anew in the faithful saying that Jesus Christ
came into the world to save the chief of sinners.
Oh may I be enabled confidingly to repose in
His matchless sacrifice, and with lively appropriating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
faith to say, "He loved <i>me</i> and gave
Himself for <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>Lord, carry on Thine own work within me.
Quicken my languid and languishing affections
by the omnipotent agency of Thy Holy Spirit.
Let me not live at a guilty distance from Thy
favor; but may I covet a close and habitual
walk with Thee, and feel the sustaining power
of Thy grace in my heart.</p>

<p>Revive Thy work in Thine own Church universal,
Thou great High Priest, who walketh in
the midst of the golden candlesticks. Do Thou
feed every lamp with the oil of Thy grace. Let
them burn with a clearer, holier, more steady
and consistent flame. As lights set in the
world, may they diffuse Thy glory; and feel
the honor of being instrumental in shedding
abroad a Saviour's love.</p>

<p>Oh may the Lord arise and have mercy upon
Zion. May the time to favor her, yea, the set
time, soon come. As there is but one Shepherd,
so may there soon be but one sheep-fold. Let
Thy churches no longer continue apart from one
another in unholy estrangement, but live in the
unity of the Spirit and in the bond of peace;
holding fast that which they have, that no man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
take their crown. Spirit of all grace, come in
all the plenitude of Thy love and mercy.
Breathe upon every portion of Thy visible
Church, and say, "Receive ye the Holy
Ghost!" "Awake, O north wind! come, thou
south! blow upon our garden, that the spices
thereof may flow out." May Thy gracious influences
descend like rain upon the mown grass,
and as showers that water the earth.</p>

<p>Bless all Thy faithful ministers. May peace
be upon them and upon the whole Israel of God.
Direct their hearts and the hearts of all Thy
faithful people into Thy love, and into the patient
waiting for Christ.</p>

<p>Comfort all in sorrow. May they see a
"need be" written on all their trials. May
they look beyond the long night-watch of earth
to the glories of that eternal morning when
clouds and darkness shall for ever flee away.</p>

<p>Take charge of me while I sleep, and as
evening after evening comes round may I feel
that a day has been spent for Thee. Hear me,
gracious Lord, for the Redeemer's sake. Amen.</p>

<h2>TWENTY-NINTH EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR SUPPORT IN DEATH.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow
of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me;
Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me."&mdash;Ps. xxiii.&nbsp;4.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God,</span> I come to Thee this night through
Jesus Christ, the Son of Thy love, beseeching
Thee to have mercy upon me, and to impart
unto me that Peace of Thine which passeth all
understanding. Blessed be Thy great and glorious
name for those hopes full of immortality
which have been opened up to me in the Gospel.
I rejoice in Christ as the great Abolisher
of death. I rejoice that the rainbow of covenant
faithfulness spans the entrance to the dark valley;
that all that is terrible in the last enemy
is in Him taken away, and that I can regard
these closing hours of existence as the introduction
and doorway into everlasting bliss.</p>

<p>Give me grace, O God, to be living in constant
preparation for death. Let me not unprofitably
squander my present golden moments.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
Let me <i>live</i> while I <i>live</i>&mdash;let me live a dying
life. Let me feel that life is a trust given me
by Thee. O Thou Great Proprietor of my
being, may this all important talent of time be
more consecrated to Thy glory. Let it not be
mine, when the hour of death arrives, to bewail,
when it is too late, lost and forfeited opportunities.
Let me not leave till then, what best can
be done and what only <i>may</i> be done now. May
it be my earnest endeavor while it is called today
to secure a saving interest in the everlasting
covenant, and then I need not fear how soon the
silver cord may be loosed and the golden bowl
broken. Through Jesus the darkness has been
taken from death, and to His own true people
its shadows will melt and merge into the brightness
of eternal day.</p>

<p>Thou art ever giving me impressive remembrances
that "at such an hour as I think not,"
the summons may come, "Prepare to meet Thy
God." The race is not to the swift nor the
battle to the strong. Verily every moment
there may be but a step between me and death.
Let me be so living a life of habitual faith in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
the Son of God that this step may be changed
into a step between me and glory.</p>

<p>Lord, prepare all who may now be laid on
dying couches for their great change. May
their eyes be directed to Jesus. Pillowing their
heads on his exceeding great and precious promises,
may they fall asleep in the glorious hope
of a joyful resurrection.</p>

<p>Bless all in sorrow; those who have recently
been bereaved of near and dear friends, who
may have been called recently to the brink of
the tomb, consigning their loved ones to the
narrow house appointed for all living. May
they be enabled to fix their sorrowing gaze on
the brighter prospects beyond death and the
grave, and anticipate that glorious hour when,
reunited to death-divided friends, they will be
able to exult together in the song, "O death,
where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy
victory?"</p>

<p>Take the charge of me this night. Watch
over me during the unconscious hours of sleep,
and when I too come to the long night and
slumber of death, may it be the gentle rest of
Thy beloved, a falling asleep in the arms of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
everlasting love, looking forward to the joyful
waking time of immortality, through Jesus
Christ my only Saviour. Amen.</p>

<h2>THIRTIETH EVENING.<br />

<span class="small">FOR PREPARATION FOR JUDGMENT.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"Prepare to meet thy God."&mdash;Amos iv.&nbsp;12.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God,</span> Thou art daily loading me with Thy
benefits. Thou art making the outgoings of
the evening and morning to rejoice over me,
giving me unnumbered causes for gratitude and
thankfulness. No earthly friend could have
loved and cared for me like Thee. Oh may the
life Thou art thus preserving by Thine unceasing
bounty be unreservedly dedicated to Thy
praise.</p>

<p>Lord, keep me mindful that I am soon to
be done with this world, that I am fast borne
along the stream of time to an endless futurity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
"It is appointed unto all once to die, and after
death the judgment." May I be living in a
constant state of preparedness for that solemn
hour when small and great shall stand before
God, and the books shall be opened. Educate
me for eternity. Let me not be frittering
away these fleeting but precious moments.
Impress on me the solemn conviction that "as
men live so do men die," that as death leaves
me so will judgment find me. Oh let death
leave me falling asleep in Jesus, united to Him
by a living faith, that so judgment may find me
seated at His right hand, listening to the joyous
welcome, "Come, ye blessed of my Father,
inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world."</p>

<p>Blessed Jesus, all my hope of a glorious resurrection
centres in Thee. I look to Thee as the
strong tower which cannot be shaken. I flee
anew to the holy sanctuary of Thy covenant
love. Sheltered there, amid a dissolving earth,
and burning worlds, I shall be able joyfully to
utter the challenge, "Who shall separate me
from the love of Christ?" Meanwhile may I
seek to "occupy" till my Lord comes. Keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
me from all negligence and unwatchfulness.
Trim my flickering lamp. Let me live with
Thy Judgment-throne in view. Whether waking
or sleeping, may I bear about with me the
thought that I must soon give an account of
myself to God. May I feel that all the talents
and means Thou hast given me are trusts to be
laid out for Thee. When thou comest to demand
a reckoning, may I not be among the
number of those who have hid their talent in
the earth, and have the cheerless retrospect of a
misspent time.</p>

<p>Lord! bless my friends, reward my benefactors,
forgive my enemies. Sanctify sorrow to
all the sons and daughters of trial. May the
torch of Thy love light up their gloomy prospects.
May every providential voice sound loud
in their ears, "Arise and depart ye, for this is
not your rest!"</p>

<p>Gracious God, watch over me during the
night, and grant that at last, when all earth's
evenings and mornings shall have passed away,
I may, on the great day-break of glory, wake
up in Thy likeness, through Him in whom is
all my hope, and to whom, with Thee, O Father,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
and Thee, ever blessed Spirit, one God, be everlasting
praise, honor, and glory, world without

<span class="small">FOR MEETING IN HEAVEN.</span></h2>

<p class="center small">"Meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints
in light."&mdash;Col. i.&nbsp;12.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O God,</span> I come into Thy gracious presence
on this the close of another day, beseeching
Thee to accept of my evening sacrifice. May
this my unworthy prayer come up before Thee
perfumed with the fragrant incense of the Saviour's
adorable merits. It is my comfort to
know, O Thou blessed Intercessor within the
veil, that Thou art even now appearing in the
presence of God for me! The names of Thy
covenant people are engraven on Thy breastplate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
and, all unworthy in themselves, they
are accepted in the Beloved.</p>

<p>My special prayer to Thee this night is,
that by Thy grace I may be made meet
for Thy blood-bought inheritance in Glory.
Transform me by the indwelling power of the
Holy Ghost; may I be dying daily unto sin,
and living daily unto righteousness. Make
me more heavenly-minded. Give me more of
a pilgrim attitude and a pilgrim spirit. May
I ever feel that my true home is above, that I
am here but a wayfarer and sojourner, as all
my fathers were. May I attain, as I advance
nearer heaven, the blessed habit of a holy life,
bearing about with me the lofty impress of one
who is born <i>from</i> above and <i>for</i> above, declaring
plainly that I seek "a better country."</p>

<p>Let me not arraign the appointments of
Infinite wisdom, but patiently await the disclosures
of the great day. Keep me from a
hasty spirit under dark dispensations. I am
no judge as to what fancied mercies are best
withholden. Let me look to every trial as an
appointed messenger from the Throne whispering
in my ears, "Be ye also ready!" May
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
I delight often to anticipate that happy time
when I shall suffer no more, and sin no more;
when Thou shalt no longer teach me by mysterious
dispensations and a crossed will; when
all shall be "a sea of glass" without one disturbing
ripple, and I shall trace with joyous
heart the long line of unbroken love and unchanging
faithfulness! Anew I would wash
in the atoning fountain. Anew I would take
refuge "in the faithful saying." O blot out
all the sins of the bygone day. Let them not
rise up in the Judgment to condemn me. Let
me close my eyes this night listening to the
Saviour's own voice&mdash;"Your sins which are
many are all forgiven you."</p>

<p>May the Lord arise and have mercy upon
Zion. May the streams of Thy grace make
glad the city of God. Build up her broken
walls; restore her ruined towers; may her
watchmen be men of faith and men of prayer;
making mention of the Lord, and keeping not
silence, till He establish, and till he make
Jerusalem again a praise in the earth.</p>

<p>Lord, bless my friends. Let us exult in
those ties which survive the uncertain ones of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
earth, and look forward to the hour when we
shall come to stand at last faultless before Thy
Throne. Oh, prepare us all for the breaking
of that eternal day&mdash;that "morning without
clouds," when in Thy light we shall see light&mdash;when
the love of Christ shall be enthroned
supremely in every heart, when the glory of
Christ will form the animating motive and
principle of life that shall never end: and all
I ask is for His sake. Amen.</p>

<p>"The book of Dr. Hallam is the best book we
have seen to put into the hands of persons desiring

<p>"The mode of treating the subject gives it full
right to a place among works on <i>practical religion</i>.
The leading object of the Lectures is to show that
this was the design and intent of the Service, and
that none who enter into its spirit can fail of being
improved by its use. There is also something in
the manner in which our author treats his subject&mdash;so
much of his own agreeable peculiarities of
thought and style characterizing it, as to throw an
air of freshness over the subject itself, rendering
the perusal as pleasant as it is profitable. In doctrine
and usage, Dr. H. follows the golden mean,

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
